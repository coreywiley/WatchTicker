So, I wanted to reach out and just see if that is something you do a lot in your job. And if so, if you had the same problem as me in just trying to wrangle everyone's schedules and then post back to them a time hoping that they would still be available. Or maybe you have a better way! Either way, I'd love to hear if you are organizing a couple people at once or maybe I can help. Let me know!</p><p>Jeremy</p>"

The shop was about selling emoji leggings and we kind of guessed that the market was more millenial girls, but it turned out all the buyers were a lot older.</p><p>Probably grandparents buying for their grand daughters.</p><p>So, here I am, wondering if I could help out some more e-commerce people.

If you are interested, I can send some more info.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>Jeremy</p>"
